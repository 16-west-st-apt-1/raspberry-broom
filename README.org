* Control Algorithm
* Roadmap
1. Real-time viewing of photo
2. Minimum time delay after finding intersection
3. Implement system to handle slanted lines with centroids still in the middle
4. Add progress calculations
5. Identify all fine-tuning parameters
   - preprocessing
     - blur level
     - threshold
6. Add alarm system with alarm/notification if doesn't find intersection in 2s
7. Make web interface with progress bar
8. Make script to convert path grid map to json config
